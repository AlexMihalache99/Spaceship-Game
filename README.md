# Spaceship-Game

A game that I made as a part of my university studies within a team of 6 people, myself included. The goal was to recreate the gameplay of Chips's Challenge. This was my first touch with the game industry and I have gained a lot of experience. Currently developing new aspects of the game. The other members of the team were:
 * Alistair Grom
 * Christopher Gibson
 * Marios Butler
 * Muhammed Fawwaz
 * William Bampton
